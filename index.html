            <div class="">
                <p>In my personal time I am working to apply and grow my skills and I am exploring ideas I acquired through
                online self-learning courses like on Udemy. I have been further expanding my knowledge through applying
                myself on some simple projects to further my understanding of these concepts. I have invested in a
                personal license for PHP Storm recently and have been learning the various functions of the software and
                it has been an amazing boost to my growth.</p>

                <p>I have created multiple small python/html projects and one-off tools in the past for various online game
                communities with my skills and so far I have solved a few recurring problems for these communities which
                is what got me hooked on programming in general.</p>

                <p>I have recently switched to learning PHP 7 any MySQL and taking my current knowledge of basic programming
                concepts and applying them there. I am diving into basic object programming with PHP and learning how to
                use MySQL. At the same time, I am learning quality enhancing tools and slowly discovering the many things
                that PHP Storm provides programmers to help with coding like PHP Unit and Composer.</p>

                <p>I have some basic HTML/CSS experience that I was able to pick up quickly due to my background in Graphics
                Arts. I am currently experimenting with PHP generating html for me and building some interactive tools
                with website frameworks like Bootstrap.</p>

                <p>I am also learning about and using Git and GitHub more and more recently for helping share my code and
                ideas with friends.</p>
